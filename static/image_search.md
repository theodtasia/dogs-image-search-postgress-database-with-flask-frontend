This project is a tool that helps you find similar dog images to one you upload. It works by analyzing the visual features of images and comparing them to a database of pre-analyzed images. The database is stored using a tool called PostgreSQL. The search results are based on the distance between the features of the uploaded image and those in the database. To use the tool, you just need to upload your image and specify how many similar images you want to see. You can also choose how the images are ranked. The tool is based on pre-trained artificial intelligence that has learned to recognize different features in images.

The project uses a dataset called the Stanford Dogs Dataset, which contains images of different dog breeds. The project allows users to search for similar images in the database by uploading their own image and selecting the number of similar images they want to retrieve and the method used for ranking the results. The system uses a pre-trained VGG16 network to extract features from the images and PostgreSQL to store the metadata.
